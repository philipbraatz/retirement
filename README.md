## üöÄ Quick Start

### Running the Console Application

```bash
# Build and run the retirement planning console
dotnet run --project RetirementPlanner.Console

# Or use VS Code
# Press F5 or use "Launch Retirement Console" configuration
```

### Basic Usage

```csharp
// Create a person
var person = new Person
{
    BirthDate = new DateTime(1975, 6, 15),
    FullRetirementAge = 67,
    SocialSecurityClaimingAge = 67,
    SocialSecurityIncome = 2400, // Monthly benefit at FRA
    EssentialExpenses = 70000,   // Annual essential expenses
    DiscretionarySpending = 20000
};

// Add retirement accounts
var traditional401k = new Traditional401kAccount(0.07, "401k", 
    DateOnly.FromDateTime(person.BirthDate), 350000);
var rothIRA = new RothIRAAccount(0.07, "Roth IRA", person, 100000);

person.Investments = new InvestmentManager([traditional401k, rothIRA]);

// Run simulation
var planner = new RetirementPlanner(person, new RetirementPlanner.Options
{
    StartDate = DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now),
    EndDate = DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now.AddYears(45)),
    ReportGranularity = TimeSpan.FromDays(365),
    TimeStep = TimeSpan.FromDays(30)
});

await planner.RunRetirementSimulation();
```
