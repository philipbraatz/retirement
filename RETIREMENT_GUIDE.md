## Key Retirement Ages and Milestones

### Age 50 - Catch-up Contributions Begin
- **401(k) Catch-up**: Additional $7,500 (2024: $7,500, 2025: $7,500)
- **IRA Catch-up**: Additional $1,000
- **Significance**: Allows accelerated retirement savings in final working years

### Age 55 - Early 401(k) Access (Rule of 55)
- **Condition**: Must separate from service with employer in year turning 55 or later
- **Benefit**: No 10% early withdrawal penalty on 401(k) from that employer
- **Important**: Does NOT apply to IRAs or 401(k)s from previous employers

### Age 59½ - General Early Withdrawal Penalty Ends
- **All retirement accounts**: No more 10% early withdrawal penalty
- **Tax treatment**: Withdrawals still subject to ordinary income tax (traditional accounts)
- **Roth exception**: Contributions can be withdrawn tax and penalty-free at any time

### Age 62 - Social Security Early Eligibility
- **Earliest age**: Can claim reduced Social Security benefits
- **Reduction**: Benefits reduced by ~25-30% compared to Full Retirement Age
- **Permanent reduction**: Benefits remain reduced for life (except for delayed retirement credits)

### Age 65 - Medicare Eligibility
- **Healthcare transition**: Employer health insurance typically ends
- **Medicare Parts A & B**: Automatic enrollment if receiving Social Security
- **Financial impact**: Healthcare costs and premiums change significantly

### Age 67 - Full Retirement Age (FRA) for Most Current Workers
- **Born 1960 or later**: FRA is 67
- **Born 1943-1954**: FRA is 66
- **Born 1955-1959**: FRA increases by 2 months per year
- **100% Social Security benefits**: No reduction for claiming at FRA

### Age 70 - Maximum Social Security Benefits
- **Delayed Retirement Credits**: 8% increase per year from FRA to 70
- **Maximum benefit**: No additional credits earned after age 70
- **Optimal claiming**: Often best to delay until 70 if possible

### Age 73 - Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) Begin
- **Effective 2023**: RMD age increased from 72 to 73
- **Accounts affected**: Traditional 401(k), 403(b), Traditional IRA, SEP-IRA, SIMPLE IRA
- **Penalty**: 25% penalty on amount not withdrawn (reduced from 50% in 2023)
- **Roth IRA exception**: No RMDs during owner's lifetime

## Retirement Account Types and Tax Treatment

### Traditional 401(k)/403(b)
- **Contributions**: Pre-tax (reduces current taxable income)
- **Growth**: Tax-deferred
- **Withdrawals**: Taxed as ordinary income
- **Early withdrawal penalty**: 10% before age 59½ (with exceptions)
- **RMDs**: Required starting at age 73

### Roth 401(k)/403(b)
- **Contributions**: After-tax (no current tax deduction)
- **Growth**: Tax-free
- **Withdrawals**: Tax-free after 5-year rule and age 59½
- **Early withdrawal**: Contributions can be withdrawn penalty-free
- **RMDs**: Required starting at age 73 (unlike Roth IRA)

### Traditional IRA
- **Contributions**: May be tax-deductible (depends on income and employer plan participation)
- **Growth**: Tax-deferred
- **Withdrawals**: Taxed as ordinary income
- **Early withdrawal penalty**: 10% before age 59½ (with exceptions)
- **RMDs**: Required starting at age 73

### SEP-IRA and SIMPLE IRA
- **Similar to Traditional IRA**: For tax treatment and RMD requirements
- **Higher contribution limits**: Especially for self-employed individuals
- **SIMPLE IRA early withdrawal**: 25% penalty in first 2 years, then 10%

## Tax Code Implications

### Ordinary Income Tax Rates (2024/2025)
Traditional retirement account withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income rates:
- 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, 37% (marginal brackets)
- **Key consideration**: Retirement income planning should consider tax bracket management

### Social Security Taxation
Social Security benefits may be partially taxable based on "provisional income":

**Provisional Income = AGI + Non-taxable interest + 50% of Social Security benefits**

#### Single Filers:
- **$0 - $25,000**: 0% of Social Security taxable
- **$25,001 - $34,000**: Up to 50% of Social Security taxable
- **$34,001+**: Up to 85% of Social Security taxable

#### Married Filing Jointly:
- **$0 - $32,000**: 0% of Social Security taxable
- **$32,001 - $44,000**: Up to 50% of Social Security taxable
- **$44,001+**: Up to 85% of Social Security taxable

### State Tax Considerations
- **State income tax**: Varies by state (some states don't tax retirement income)
- **State-specific**: Some states don't tax Social Security, others do
- **Moving strategies**: Consider tax-friendly retirement states

## Social Security

### Benefit Calculation
1. **Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME)**: Based on 35 highest-earning years
2. **Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)**: Formula applied to AIME
3. **Bend Points (2024)**: 90% of first $1,174, 32% of next $5,904, 15% above $7,078

### Claiming Strategies
- **Early claiming (62-FRA)**: Permanent reduction
- **Normal claiming (FRA)**: 100% of PIA
- **Delayed claiming (FRA-70)**: 8% increase per year

### Work in Retirement
- **Before FRA**: $1 reduction for every $2 earned above $22,320 (2024)
- **Year of FRA**: $1 reduction for every $3 earned above $59,520 (2024)
- **After FRA**: No earnings limit

## Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)

### RMD Calculation
**RMD = Account Balance (Dec 31 prior year) ÷ Life Expectancy Factor**

### Life Expectancy Tables
- **Uniform Lifetime Table**: Most common (assumes beneficiary 10 years younger)
- **Joint Life Table**: When spouse is >10 years younger and sole beneficiary
- **Single Life Table**: For inherited accounts

### Key RMD Rules
- **First RMD**: Due by April 1 following year you turn 73
- **Subsequent RMDs**: Due by December 31 each year
- **Still working exception**: 401(k) RMDs can be delayed if still working (not for IRAs)
- **Aggregation rules**: IRA RMDs can be taken from any IRA; 401(k) RMDs must come from each plan

### RMD Penalties
- **Penalty**: 25% of amount not withdrawn (reduced from 50% in 2023)
- **Correction**: Can request waiver if due to reasonable error

## Early Withdrawal Penalties and Exceptions

### 10% Early Withdrawal Penalty Exceptions

#### Traditional and Roth IRAs:
1. **First-time home purchase**: Up to $10,000 lifetime limit
2. **Higher education expenses**: For taxpayer, spouse, children, grandchildren
3. **Medical expenses**: Exceeding 7.5% of AGI
4. **Health insurance premiums**: While unemployed
5. **Disability**: Permanent and total disability
6. **Substantially Equal Periodic Payments (SEPP)**: Rule 72(t)

2. **Hardship withdrawals**: Immediate and heavy financial need

- **Calculation methods**: 
  1. Required Minimum Distribution method
  2. Fixed amortization method
  3. Fixed annuitization method

## Implementation Considerations

### For Retirement Planning Software:

#### Critical Age-Based Triggers:
1. **Age 50**: Enable catch-up contributions
2. **Age 55**: Enable Rule of 55 for 401(k) if separated from service
3. **Age 59½**: Remove early withdrawal penalties
4. **Age 62**: Enable Social Security claiming (with reductions)
5. **Age 65**: Medicare eligibility (affects healthcare costs)
6. **Age 67**: Full Retirement Age for most current workers
7. **Age 70**: Maximum Social Security benefits
8. **Age 73**: Mandatory RMDs begin

#### Tax Calculations:

### Compliance Considerations:
- IRS regulations change annually (contribution limits, thresholds)
- State tax laws vary and change
- Social Security parameters adjust annually
- Keep current with tax law changes (SECURE Act, SECURE 2.0, etc.)

This guide should serve as the foundation for implementing accurate retirement planning calculations and ensuring compliance with current tax regulations.
