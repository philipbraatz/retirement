# Account Types & Tax Implications

## Overview

Understanding the tax implications of different retirement account types is crucial for optimal retirement planning. Each account type has specific rules regarding contributions, growth, and withdrawals that significantly impact your overall tax strategy.

## Traditional 401(k) Accounts

### Tax Treatment
- **Contributions:** Pre-tax (reduces current year taxable income)
- **Growth:** Tax-deferred (no taxes on gains while invested)
- **Withdrawals:** Taxed as ordinary income

### Contribution Limits (2025)
- **Under Age 50:** $23,500
- **Age 50+:** $31,000 (includes $7,500 catch-up contribution)
- **Employer Match:** Not counted toward employee limits

### Key Rules and Calculations

**Tax Savings Example:**
```
Annual Salary: $100,000
401(k) Contribution: $20,000
Marginal Tax Rate: 24%

Current Year Tax Savings:
$20,000 × 24% = $4,800

Adjusted Gross Income:
$100,000 - $20,000 = $80,000
```

**Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs):**
- Begin at age 73
- Calculated using IRS Uniform Lifetime Table
- Penalty for insufficient distribution: 25% of shortfall

**RMD Calculation Example:**
```
Age 75, December 31 Balance: $500,000
Life Expectancy Factor: 24.6

Required Distribution: $500,000 ÷ 24.6 = $20,325
Tax on Distribution: $20,325 × 22% = $4,472
```

### Early Withdrawal Rules

**10% Penalty Exceptions:**
- Age 59½ or older
- Rule of 55 (separation from service at age 55+)
- Substantially Equal Periodic Payments (SEPP)
- Hardship withdrawals (limited circumstances)

**Rule of 55 Example:**
```
Employee Age: 56
Separates from Company: Eligible
401(k) Balance: $300,000
Withdrawal: $50,000
Penalty: $0 (Rule of 55 applies)
Income Tax: $50,000 × marginal rate
```

## Roth 401(k) Accounts

### Tax Treatment
- **Contributions:** After-tax (no current deduction)
- **Growth:** Tax-free
- **Qualified Withdrawals:** Tax-free

### Contribution Limits
Same as Traditional 401(k):
- **Under Age 50:** $23,500
- **Age 50+:** $31,000

### Qualification Rules

**5-Year Rule:**
- Account must be open for 5 years
- Withdrawals after age 59½ are tax-free
- Applies to each conversion separately

**Tax-Free Withdrawal Example:**
```
Roth 401(k) Contribution (5 years ago): $20,000
Current Value: $28,000
Age 62 Withdrawal: $28,000
Tax Owed: $0
```

### Required Minimum Distributions
- **During Owner's Lifetime:** RMDs required starting at age 73
- **Solution:** Roll to Roth IRA to eliminate RMDs

## Traditional IRA

### Contribution Limits (2025)
- **Under Age 50:** $7,000
- **Age 50+:** $8,000

### Deduction Phase-Outs (2025)

**With Workplace Retirement Plan:**
- Single: $77,000 - $87,000 (full to no deduction)
- Married Filing Jointly: $123,000 - $143,000

**Without Workplace Plan:**
- Single: No income limit
- Married (spouse has plan): $230,000 - $240,000

**Deduction Calculation Example:**
```
Single Filer with 401(k)
AGI: $82,000 (within phase-out range)

Phase-out calculation:
$82,000 - $77,000 = $5,000 excess
$5,000 ÷ $10,000 = 50% phase-out

Deductible Amount: $7,000 × (1 - 0.50) = $3,500
```

### Withdrawal Rules
Same as Traditional 401(k):
- Taxed as ordinary income
- 10% penalty before age 59½ (with exceptions)
- RMDs start at age 73

## Roth IRA

### Contribution Limits
Same as Traditional IRA:
- **Under Age 50:** $7,000
- **Age 50+:** $8,000

### Income Limits (2025)

**Phase-Out Ranges:**
- Single: $138,000 - $153,000
- Married Filing Jointly: $218,000 - $228,000

**Contribution Calculation Example:**
```
Single Filer AGI: $145,000

Phase-out calculation:
$145,000 - $138,000 = $7,000 excess
$7,000 ÷ $15,000 = 46.7% phase-out

Allowed Contribution: $7,000 × (1 - 0.467) = $3,731
```

### Advanced Strategies

**Backdoor Roth IRA:**
For high-income earners exceeding income limits:

```
Step 1: Contribute $7,000 to non-deductible Traditional IRA
Step 2: Convert to Roth IRA
Step 3: Pay taxes on conversion (minimal if done quickly)

Tax Calculation:
If immediate conversion: Tax = $0 (no growth)
If delayed conversion with growth: Tax on gains only
```

**Mega Backdoor Roth:**
Using after-tax 401(k) contributions:

```
Total 401(k) Limit (2025): $70,000
Employee + Employer Contributions: $31,000 + $6,000 = $37,000
Available for After-Tax: $70,000 - $37,000 = $33,000

Process:
1. Contribute $33,000 after-tax to 401(k)
2. In-service distribution or rollover to Roth IRA
3. Pay taxes only on growth since contribution
```

### Withdrawal Rules

**Contribution Withdrawals:**
- Always penalty-free and tax-free
- Can withdraw original contributions anytime

**Earnings Withdrawals:**
- 5-year rule applies
- Must be age 59½ for tax-free withdrawal
- Exceptions for first home, education, etc.

**Withdrawal Order (IRS Ordering Rules):**
1. Original contributions (tax and penalty-free)
2. Conversion principal (tax-free, penalty if < 5 years and < 59½)
3. Earnings (subject to taxes and penalties if not qualified)

## Health Savings Account (HSA)

### Triple Tax Advantage
1. **Deductible Contributions:** Reduce current taxable income
2. **Tax-Free Growth:** No taxes on investment gains
3. **Tax-Free Withdrawals:** For qualified medical expenses

### Contribution Limits (2025)
- **Individual Coverage:** $4,150
- **Family Coverage:** $8,300

### Retirement Strategy

**Medical Expense Strategy:**
```
Age 65+ Withdrawal Options:
1. Medical Expenses: Tax-free
2. Non-Medical Expenses: Taxed as ordinary income (no penalty)

Effective Tax Treatment: Same as Traditional IRA after age 65
Additional Benefit: Tax-free medical withdrawals
```

**HSA as Retirement Account Example:**
```
Annual Contribution (Age 55): $4,150
Investment Period: 15 years to age 70
Growth Rate: 7%
Future Value: $4,150 × 25.129 = $104,285

Medical Expense Withdrawal at Age 70:
Amount: $104,285
Tax Owed: $0
```

## Taxable Investment Accounts

### Tax Treatment
- **Contributions:** After-tax dollars (no deduction)
- **Growth:** Taxed annually on dividends and interest
- **Capital Gains:** Taxed when realized

### Capital Gains Tax Rates (2025)

**Long-Term Capital Gains (held > 1 year):**
- 0%: Income up to $47,025 (single), $94,050 (married)
- 15%: Income up to $518,900 (single), $583,750 (married)
- 20%: Income above thresholds

**Tax Loss Harvesting Example:**
```
Stock A Gain: $10,000
Stock B Loss: $8,000
Net Gain: $2,000

Tax Calculation:
$2,000 × 15% = $300 (vs. $1,500 without harvesting)
Tax Savings: $1,200
```

### Advantages in Retirement
- No RMDs
- Flexible access to principal
- Step-up in basis at death
- Tax-loss harvesting opportunities

Taxable Accounts:
- Tax-efficient investments
- Index funds, individual stocks (for step-up basis)
```

### Withdrawal Strategy by Life Phase

**Pre-Medicare (Ages 59½-65):**
```
Priority Order:
1. Taxable accounts (capital gains rates)
2. Roth contributions (tax-free)
3. Traditional accounts (fill lower tax brackets)
```

**Early Retirement Bridge (Ages 55-59½):**
```
Special Considerations:
- Rule of 55 for 401(k) access
- SEPP for IRA access
- Taxable account bridge strategy
```

**RMD Phase (Age 73+):**
```
Required Distributions:
- Use RMDs to meet spending needs

```
